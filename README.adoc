# 🗼CCAligner image:https://travis-ci.org/saurabhshri/CCAligner.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/saurabhshri/CCAligner"]

Word by word audio subtitle synchronization tool and API. Being developed under Google Summer of Code 2017 with CCExtractor.

_(https://saurabhshri.github.io/)_

---

_There are two major branches in this repository - `master` and `development`._

_The `master` branch is updated at the end of each phase (currently it has code which was written in the second phase) and the `development` branch is regularly updated as the work proceeds. At the end of each phase, the development branch is merged with the `master` branch._

_The project is in it's very early stage and is constantly evolving. The available functions, usage instructions et cetera are expected to refactor over time. It is not production ready but you are welcome to play with it, or better, help improve it! :)_

== Using CCAligner

CCAligner can be used as both standalone tool or a library in your own project.

=== Installing Dependencies ===

To automatically generate language models, dictionaries and grammars, following dependencies need to be met. The tool has capability to generate them without these dependencies, but the accuracy in that case is not guaranteed. It is highly recommended to work with the dependencies installed.

1. cmuclmtk : to generate vocab and LM.
    _(https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/cmuclmtk/0.7/cmuclmtk-0.7.tar.gz/download)_
2. g2p-seq2seq  (to generate dictionary).  
    _(https://github.com/cmusphinx/g2p-seq2seq)_

*Steps :*

*Linux/MacOS*

To install cmuclmtk :

1. Download cmuclmtk from the link mentioned above and uncompress `cmuclmtk-0.7.tar.gz` while preserving the permissions :

    tar xvpzf cmuclmtk-0.7.tar.gz

2. Navigate to `cmumltk-0.7` directory :

    cd cmuclmtk-0.7

3. Install :

    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

You may have to run `sudo ldconfig` to fix errors such as missing shared library.

To install g2p-seq2seq :

1. First, install Tensorflow by your preferred choice of method. If you are on Linux (x86_64), you may directly run the following :

    sudo pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-1.0.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl

2. Download g2p-seq2seq from the link mentioned above and uncompress `g2p-seq2seq-master.zip` while preserving the permissions :

    unzip g2p-seq2seq-master.zip

3. Navigate to `g2p-seq2seq-master` directory and run :

    sudo python setup.py install


*I have incorporated above steps into a bash script located inside `install/` directory, that you may simply call using :*

    `./install_grammar_tools.sh`

In case you have some trouble with dependencies, I have mirrored the last known working versions of them in the repository at : _(https://github.com/saurabhshri/mirror/)_ .

The alternate ways of generating language models, dictionaries and grammars are covered later in the docs.


*Windows*

To install cmuclmtk :

1. Download cmuclmtk from the link mentioned above and uncompress `cmuclmtk-0.7.tar.gz`. Build it with the `cmuclmtk.sln` it provides.

2. Copy the compiled files (wfreq2vocab.exe, text2wfreq.exe, text2idngram.exe, idngram2lm.exe) to the same directory as the CCAligner
   or you can set the directory contains these files to environment variable (PATH)

To install g2p-seq2seq :

1. First, install Python 3.5 (64-bit) and Tensorflow 1.0.0 by your preferred choice of method

2. Download g2p-seq2seq from the link mentioned above and uncompress `g2p-seq2seq-master.zip`

3. Navigate to `g2p-seq2seq-master` directory and run :

    python setup.py install
    
You will also need to install http://www.perl.org/get.html[Perl] and move install/quick_lm.pl to the same directory as the CCAligner or a dictionary that is set in the environment variable PATH
    
=== Before You Run ===

1. Please make sure you have all the dependencies installed in case you want to use grammar tools. To disable generating grammar by CCAligner, issue `--generate-grammar no`.

2. Make sure the `model` folder and `g2p-seq2seq-cmudict` are in the directory where you are compiling CCAligner.

3. Make sure the subtitles are clean and are in propar SRT format.

4. The wav file should be 16 bit PCM mono sampled at 16KHz. To generate the wavefile using a video through ffmpeg, you may :

    ./ffmpeg -i input.video -bits_per_raw_sample 16 -ar 16000 -ac 1 output.wav

=== Installing ===

*Linux/MacOS*

1. Clone the repository from Github using :

    git clone https://www.github.com/saurabhshri/CCAligner.git

2. Navigate to `install` directory and run `build.sh`.

    cd install/
    ./build.sh

3. Align!

    ./ccaligner <arguments>

*Windows*

1. Clone the repository from Github using :

    git clone https://www.github.com/saurabhshri/CCAligner.git

2. Use CMake to generate project files, and then build it.

3. Align!

    .\ccaligner <arguments>

    
=== Quick Demo ===

The default output of CCAligner is stored as an XML file. For example, the next command will generate `file.xml` :

    ./ccaligner -wav /path/to/file.wav -srt /path/to/file.srt

=== API or Library usage ===

1. Clone the repository from Github :

    git clone https://github.com/saurabhshri/CCAligner.git

2. Place the `CCAligner` folder in appropriate directory in your project.

3. In your project, simply include the directories and source file you wish to use. You may refer to CMakeLists.txt in the `src/` directory to get an idea. The CCAligner tool is built arround the CCAligner API.

For example : If you want to use the audio based alignement in your project

```cpp

//include the header file
#include "recognize_using_pocketsphinx.h"

//Declare the aligner
PocketsphinxAligner * aligner = new PocketsphinxAligner(_parameters);

//Align
aligner->align();

//Print the result
aligner->printAligned("Manual_Printing.json", json);

//delete the aligner
delete(aligner);

```

Complete documentation of the API will be written under docs.

|===

== Project Details ==

The usual subtitle files (such as SubRips) have line by line synchronization in them i.e. the subtitles containing the dialogue appear when the person starts talking and disappears when the dialogue finishes. This continues for the whole video. For example :

```bash
1274
01:55:48,484 --> 01:55:50,860
The Force is strong with this one
```
In the above example, the dialogue `#1274` - `The Force is strong with this one` appears at `1:55:48` remains in the screen for two seconds and disappears at `1:55:50`.

The aim of the project is to tag the word *as it is spoken*, similar to that in karaoke systems.

E.g.
```
The           [6948484:6948500]
Force         [6948501:6948633]
is            [6948634:6948710]
strong        [6948711:6949999]
with          [6949100:6949313]
```
In the above example each word from subtitle is tagged with beginning and ending timestamps based on audio.
